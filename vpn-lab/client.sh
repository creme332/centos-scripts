# Script Name: Setup OpenVPN Client on Linux
# Description: Configures an OpenVPN client to connect to a remote
#              OpenVPN server. Copies certificates from the server
#              and generates a client.ovpn configuration file.
#              Works on CentOS/RHEL and other Linux distributions.
# Usage: Run the script as root using bash openvpn_client.sh
# Version: 0.0
# Author: creme332
#--------------------------------------------------------------
# Requirements:
# - CentOS 7 with root privileges
# - OpenVPN installed (script installs if missing)
# - Access to server's ca.crt, client.crt, and client.key files
# - Internet connectivity for package installation
